# Python for Physics: 

This repository houses a curated selection of Python scripts that I wrote over 5 years ago. While these scripts may represent an early stage in my coding journey, they embody foundational concepts and problem-solving approaches in computational physics. 

### 1. Football Board Ball Dynamics:
This script contains a Python-based simulation of ball dynamics on a football board. The code models the movement of the ball across the board with considerations for physical factors such as force and impacts with the board boundaries.

### 2. Argon Gas Crystallization Simulation:
The script `MD_argon_crystallization.py` models the crystallization process of Argon gas under specific conditions. Using principles from statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, this project demonstrates the phase transition of Argon from a gaseous to a crystalline state.

### 3. Quantum Potential Barrier Simulation:
This script contains a computational tool designed to simulate particle interactions with a potential barrier, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. The simulation visualizes how quantum particles, such as electrons, behave when encountering a potential barrier that they classically shouldn't be able to cross.

### 4. 2D Particle Density Calculation with Pandas:
In many physical simulations or experimental data analyses, determining the density distribution of particles across a plane is a common task. Typically, one might loop over arrays of x and y coordinates to compute densities, which can be computationally expensive. This project uses the powerful data manipulation capabilities provided by pandas to expedite this process.
This repository demonstrates the use of the pandas library in Python to efficiently compute the two-dimensional density of particles based on their x and y coordinates. It showcases how vectorized operations in pandas can significantly outperform traditional for-loop approaches in terms of speed and performance.

### 5. Equipotential Calculation for Linear Charge Distribution:
Equipotential lines represent loci of points in a field where the potential is constant. Understanding these lines is crucial for various applications in physics and engineering. The tool presented here calculates the equipotential lines due to a linear arrangement of charged particles, accounting for both Coulomb interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions.
This script contains a computational tool that calculates the equipotential lines generated by a linear charge distribution, considering both Coulombic (electrostatic) and Lennard-Jones potentials. It aims to visualize the potential field around a string of charged beads, which can be used for educational purposes or in electrostatics simulations in physics and materials science.
