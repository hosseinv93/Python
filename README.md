# Python for Physics: A Foundational Collection

This repository houses a curated selection of Python scripts that I wrote over 5 years ago, aimed at tackling fundamental physics problems. While these scripts may represent an early stage in my coding journey, they embody foundational concepts and problem-solving approaches in computational physics. These pieces of code serve as a testament to my growth as a developer and physicist, and they may offer insights or a starting point for those new to applying Python in the field of physics.
